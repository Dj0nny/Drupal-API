# Drupal API

Drupal is one of the most famous open source CMS. Written in PHP, the first version was relesed in the 2001. Drupal can be used for building a very complex web site and it can be extended thanks to its many modules, or using its APIs, already integrated into the __core__.
Many famous sites have chosen Drupal as CMS:
* NASA
* Oxford University
* NBC
* Tesla Motors
* CNN
* Virgin

Drupal's Web Site: https://www.drupal.org

For testing the APIs, I'll use this web site http://drupalapis.altervista.org/

### Site Structure ###

Inside the __Site Structure__ folder there are the core elements of the site. Because I use Drupal's API, I have customized some pages.

### Views ###

The term __View__ in Drupal displays all elemnts that matched with filtres. You can build a view with a specific module, or using the EntityFieldQuery API.
